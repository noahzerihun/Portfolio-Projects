{"cells":[{"source":"![A car dashboard with lots of new technical features.](images/dashboard.jpg)\n\nYou're working for a well-known car manufacturer who is looking at implementing LLMs into vehicles to provide guidance to drivers. You've been asked to experiment with integrating car manuals with an LLM to create a context-aware chatbot. They hope that this context-aware LLM can be hooked up to a text-to-speech software to read the model's response aloud.\n\nAs a proof of concept, you'll integrate several pages from a car manual that contains car warning messages and their meanings and recommended actions. This particular manual, stored as an HTML file, `mg-zs-warning-messages.html`, is from an MG ZS automobile, a compact SUV. Armed with your newfound knowledge of LLMs and LangChain, you'll implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create the context-aware chatbot.\n\n**Note: Although we'll be using the OpenAI API in this project, you do not need to specify an API key.**","metadata":{},"id":"f2edba47-9e2e-476e-9f2f-fb177b329063","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Install the libraries needed for the project\nimport subprocess\nimport pkg_resources\n\ndef install_if_needed(package, version):\n    '''Function to ensure that the libraries used are consistent to avoid errors.'''\n    try:\n        pkg = pkg_resources.get_distribution(package)\n        if pkg.version != version:\n            raise pkg_resources.VersionConflict(pkg, version)\n    except (pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound, pkg_resources.VersionConflict):\n        subprocess.check_call([\"pip\", \"install\", f\"{package}=={version}\"])\n\ninstall_if_needed(\"langchain-core\", \"0.3.72\")\ninstall_if_needed(\"langchain-openai\", \"0.3.28\")\ninstall_if_needed(\"langchain-community\", \"0.3.27\")\ninstall_if_needed(\"unstructured\", \"0.18.11\")\ninstall_if_needed(\"langchain-chroma\", \"0.2.5\")\ninstall_if_needed(\"langchain-text-splitters\", \"0.3.9\")\n\n# Import the required packages\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredHTMLLoader\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain_chroma import Chroma\nimport os\n\n# Load the HTML as a LangChain document loader\nloader = UnstructuredHTMLLoader(file_path=\"data/mg-zs-warning-messages.html\")\ncar_docs = loader.load()\n\n# Load the models required to complete the exercise\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0)\n# FIX: Use a supported embedding model\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(\n    model=\"text-embedding-3-small\",  # Specify a supported embedding model\n    openai_api_key=os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n)\n\n# Initialize RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to make chunks of HTML text\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)\n\n# Split the car documents with text_splitter\nsplits = text_splitter.split_documents(car_docs)\n\n# Initialize Chroma vectorstore with documents as splits and using OpenAIEmbeddings\nvectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embeddings)\n\n# Setup vectorstore as retriever\nretriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()\n\n# Define RAG prompt\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\n    \"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.
